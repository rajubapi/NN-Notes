    "The main use of loss function is to measure the difference or inconsistency between the predicted value ($ \\begin{align}\\hat{y}\\end {align}$) and actual label ($ \\begin{align}y\\end {align}$). The robustness of the neural network increases with the decrease in the value of loss function.The number of misclassified patterns contribute to the change in inupt parameters. Few of the loss functions are listed below:\n",
