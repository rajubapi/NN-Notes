The weight values are constantly adjusted until the value of $ E_p$ is no longer decreasing. Since the RMS error value is very complex function with many parameter values of weights, it is possible that the backpropagation network may converge into a local minima instead of the desired global minimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model. Parameters refer to weights in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting at the top, we take our first step downhill in the direction specified by the negative gradient. Next we recalculate the negative gradient (passing in the coordinates of our new point) and take another step in the direction it specifies. We continue this process iteratively until we get to the bottom of our graph, or to a point where we can no longer move downhill–a local minimum.\n",

    "### Learning rate\n",
    "The size of these steps is called the learning rate. With a high learning rate we can cover more ground each step, but we risk overshooting the lowest point since the slope of the hill is constantly changing. With a very low learning rate, we can confidently move in the direction of the negative gradient since we are recalculating it so frequently. A low learning rate is more precise, but calculating the gradient is time-consuming, so it will take us a very long time to get to the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost function\n",

    "### Gradient descent variants\n",
    "There are three variants of gradient descent, which differ in how much data we use to compute the gradient of the objective function. Depending on the amount of data, we make a trade-off between the accuracy of the parameter update and the time it takes to perform an update.\n",

    "#### Batch gradient descent\n",
    "Vanilla gradient descent, aka batch gradient descent, computes the gradient of the cost function w.r.t. to the parameters $\\theta$ for the entire training dataset: $\\theta = \\theta - \\eta * \\nabla_\\theta * J(\\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we need to calculate the gradients for the whole dataset to perform just one update, batch gradient descent can be very slow and is intractable for datasets that don't fit in memory. Batch gradient descent also doesn't allow us to update our model online, i.e. with new examples on-the-fly."

    "SGD performs frequent updates with a high variance that cause the objective function to fluctuate heavily as in Image 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "While batch gradient descent converges to the minimum of the basin the parameters are placed in, SGD's fluctuation, on the one hand, enables it to jump to new and potentially better local minima. On the other hand, this ultimately complicates convergence to the exact minimum, as SGD will keep overshooting. However, it has been shown that when we slowly decrease the learning rate, SGD shows the same convergence behaviour as batch gradient descent, almost certainly converging to a local or the global minimum for non-convex and convex optimization respectively. Note that we shuffle the training data at every epoch.\n",

    "Learning rate schedules try to adjust the learning rate during training by e.g. annealing, i.e. reducing the learning rate according to a pre-defined schedule or when the change in objective between epochs falls below a threshold. These schedules and thresholds, however, have to be defined in advance and are thus unable to adapt to a dataset's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
