    "The hidden layer projects the inputs into a space where we can find a linear seperation. Any continuous function can be represented or approximated by many number of nodes in the hidden layer. Now let us try to create a neural network architecture for the below example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network has to detect if the point is located in the traingular region or not.\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>It can be clearly observed that the data set is **NOT** Linearly seperable.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The number of inputs is 2 (because it is 2 dimensional).</li>\n",
    "    <li>The number of hidden units required in the hidden layer is 3 because, we know that each hidden unit represents a line and as, in the given example the neural network has to distinguish between the points present inside and ouside of the triangular (3 edges) region  we require 3 hidden nodes.</li>\n",

    "If the point falls inside the triangular region then the neural network should return the value 1 else it should return 0.\n",
    "#### Line I:\n",
    "1. If point is **above** Line I then it can be represented as **1**\n",
    "2. If point is **below** Line I then it can be represented as **0**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Line II:\n",
    "1. If point is **left** Line II then it can be represented as **1**\n",
    "2. If point is **right** Line II then it can be represented as **0**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Line III:\n",
    "1. If point is **right** Line III then it can be represented as **1**\n",
    "2. If point is **left** Line III then it can be represented as **0**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the combination of line I,II,III is **111** then we can say that the point lies in the traingular region.\n",
    "The above problem can be realised as the below neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/network1.png\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, now let us consider the below example in which the output of the neural network should be 1 if the data point lies in either of the two regions.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case as there are 6 lines we require 6 hidden  nodes to represent each one of them. And also we need one mode hidden layer in order to implement **OR** gate.\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/network2.png\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "The 1st hidden layer implements 2 **AND** gates and the 2nd hidden layer implements **OR** gate."
