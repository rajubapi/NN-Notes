# Preface

The journey started with the
**"Introduction to Neural and Cognitive Modeling"** (later a textbook
came out with the same title) course offered by [Prof. Daniel Levine](https://www.uta.edu/psychology/people/daniel-levine.php) at UT Arlington in the late 80's. He started the fire!
[Dr. Guido Bugmann](https://www.fose1.plymouth.ac.uk/socem/staff/Guido_Bugmann/bugmann.htm)
and I offered an **"Introduction to Neurocomputing"** course during
1995-1997 at University of Plymoouth. Later this has been offered over
the years at University of Hyderabad since 1999 and as part of the
Statistical Methods in AI (SMAI) course at IIIT-H during 2014-2017. The
2018 batch of MTech students at University of Hyderabad committed it as Blog of Notes. Especially, **Sai Somanath** and **Krutika** took the leadership in building it ground up.

Acknowledgments are due to [Prof. Kenji Doya](https://groups.oist.jp/ncu/kenji-doya), Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and [Prof. B. L. Deekshatulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._L._Deekshatulu), for mentorship and
[Prof. N. Yadaiah](http://jntuhceh.org/faculty_details/2/dept/302), JNTU, Hyderabad for friendship. The textbooks of Prof. Simon Haykin and Prof. B. Yegnanarayana have been the guiding lights.

These course notes are intended to give the conceptual foundation of
Neural Networks and complement the recent spurt in nice blogs on Deep
Neural Networks. The notes cover basics of Supervised and Unsupervised
Learning and are suitable for self-study with animated examples. Still
to come are Recurrent Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Hopfield
Network, Boltzmann Machine, Convolutional Neural Networks, and
Applications. This is work-in-progress, a long read ahead! Enjoy!
