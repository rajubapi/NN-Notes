    "# Hopfield Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hopfield neural network is a type of artificial neural network invented by John Hopfield in 1982.\n",
    "It usually works by first learning a number of binary patterns and then returning the one that is the most similar to a given input. It consists of a single layer which contains one or more fully connected recurrent neurons. The Hopfield network is commonly used for auto-association and optimization tasks.\n",
